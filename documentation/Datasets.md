# Agricultural Yield Climate Impact Analysis System

## Dataset Overview

The Agricultural Yield Climate Impact Analysis System utilizes two primary data sources:

1. **USDA Census of Agriculture Data (1997-2017)**: Contains crop yield, harvested acres, and production data for major field crops across the United States.

2. **PRISM Climate Data**: High-resolution spatial climate datasets containing temperature, precipitation, and other climate variables.

This document details the raw datasets, processing methods, and resulting cleaned datasets used throughout the system.

   - Download monthly climate data for census years
   - Process and extract from GeoTIFF format

2. **Spatial Aggregation** (`src/features/spatial_aggregation.py`):
   - Aggregate 4km gridded data to state level
   - Calculate area-weighted averages
   - Align with administrative boundaries

3. **Temporal Alignment** (`src/features/temporal_alignment.py`):
   - Align climate data with growing seasons for each crop
   - Calculate seasonal averages and totals
   - Match with census years

### Feature Engineering

1. **Climate Feature Derivation** (`src/features/prism_feature_engineering.py`):
   - Calculate growing degree days (base 10째C)
   - Derive heat stress indices (days above threshold)
   - Compute drought indicators
   - Determine frost-free period length

2. **Data Integration** (`src/data/integrate_data.py`):
   - Merge USDA yield data with PRISM climate data
   - Align spatial and temporal dimensions
   - Create crop-specific integrated datasets
   - Generate final analysis-ready datasets

## Cleaned Datasets

The data processing pipeline produces several cleaned datasets:

## Sample Data Generation

For development and testing, the system can generate synthetic sample data:

1. **USDA Sample Data Generation** (`train_model.py:create_sample_usda_data`):
   - Creates realistic yield, acreage, and production values
   - Maintains correct relationships between variables
   - Covers all census years and major crops

2. **PRISM Sample Data Generation** (`train_model.py:create_sample_prism_data`):
   - Generates realistic climate variables with proper relationships
   - Includes systematic trends to simulate climate change
   - Ensures variable ranges match real-world data

## Data Access Code

The data acquisition and processing code is located in the following files:

1. **USDA Data Download**: `src/data/download_usda_data.py`
2. **PRISM Data Download**: `src/data/download_prism_data.py`
3. **Data Integration**: `src/data/integrate_data.py`
4. **Sample Data Creation**: `train_model.py`

## Dataset Usage in the System

The cleaned, integrated datasets are used throughout the system for:

1. **Historical Analysis**: Time series visualization and comparison of crop yields
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Examining relationships between climate variables and yields
3. **Model Training**: Creating machine learning models to predict yields
4. **Scenario Analysis**: Simulating potential climate change impacts

## Data Limitations and Considerations

1. **Temporal Resolution**: The USDA data is limited to 5-year intervals (census years)
2. **Spatial Aggregation**: Climate data is aggregated to state level, losing some local variation
3. **Sample Data**: When using generated sample data, results are illustrative rather than actual predictions
4. **Climate Variables**: Limited to temperature and precipitation metrics; other factors like CO2 levels not included

## Conclusion

The data processing pipeline transforms raw USDA agricultural data and PRISM climate data into clean, integrated datasets ready for analysis and modeling. The system provides both actual data processing capabilities and sample data generation for development and demonstration purposes.
